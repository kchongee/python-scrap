    - ```which python``` to check which virtual environment was using
    - ```deactivate``` to leave/deactivate current virtual environment
    - ```pip install [packages]==[version]``` to install desire packages in desire version
    - ```pip freeze > requirements.txt``` to write all the packages installed in virtual environment into requirements.txt
