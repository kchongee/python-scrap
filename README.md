step 3: activate virtual environment
```source venv/Scripts/activate```

step 4: install required python packages/libraries 
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all the packages written in the requirements.txt

step 5: run web scraping script

### Note
- ```which python``` to check which virtual environment was using
- ```deactivate``` to leave current virtual environment
- ```which python``` to check which virtual environment was using
- ```pip install [packages]==[version]``` to install desire packages in desire version
- ```pip freeze > requirements.txt``` to write all the packages installed in virtual environment into requirements.txt
- virtual environment here similar to project dependencies, pip similar to composer in php, TLDR: venv = composer + phpenv
